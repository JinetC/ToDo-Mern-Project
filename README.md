# ToDo-Mern-Project
JinethC_ToDo_App

I Build and Deploy My very first MERN project with the help of named Tyler Potts Youtuber.

Introduction

In this project, I learned the following:

What is Mongo DB and how it works? Also, I learn to react, express, and nodejs. In this project, I try to understand CRUD operation with the API. 
Therefore, I clearly understand how the full stack application work means how the backend interacts with the frontend and get, post, and delete data. It is a TODO app.

In this application, I can put any task to do then if I completed that task I can cut that task. If I want to delete that task it is also can do.

It is a small project but very helpful for understanding the basic concept.
